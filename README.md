AWS VPN Gateway Terraform module
================================

Terraform module which creates [VPN gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_VPN.html) resources on AWS.

This module creates:
* a [VPN Connection](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/vpn_connection.html) unless `create_vpn_connection = false`
* a [VPN Gateway Attachment](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/vpn_gateway_attachment.html)
* one or more [VPN Gateway Route Propagation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/vpn_gateway_route_propagation.html) depending on how many routing tables exists in a VPC
* one or more [VPN Connection Route](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/vpn_connection_route.html) if `create_vpn_connection = true` and `vpn_connection_static_routes_only = true`, and depending on the number of destinations provided in variable `vpn_connection_static_routes_destinations` (which must be inline with `vpc_subnet_route_table_count`)

This module does not create a [VPN Gateway](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/vpn_gateway.html) resource because it is meant to be used in combination with the [VPC module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws) that will create that resource (when `enable_vpn_gateway = true`).
This module also does not create a [Customer Gateway](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/customer_gateway.html) resource.
This module will create static routes for the VPN Connection if configured to create a VPN Connection resource with static routes and destinations for the routes have been provided.
The static routes will then be automatically propagated to the VPC subnet routing tables (provided in `private_route_table_ids`) once a VPN tunnel status is `UP`.
When static routes are disabled, the appliance behind the Customer Gateway needs to support BGP routing protocol in order for routes to be automatically discovered, and subsequently propagated to the VPC subnet routing tables.

Usage
-----

##### With [VPC module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws)

```hcl
module "vpn_gateway" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/vpn-gateway/aws"

  vpc_id                  = "${module.vpc.vpc_id}"
  vpn_gateway_id          = "${module.vpc.vgw_id}"
  customer_gateway_id     = "${aws_customer_gateway.main.id}"
  private_route_table_ids = ["${module.vpc.private_route_table_ids}"]
}

resource "aws_customer_gateway" "main" {
  bgp_asn    = 65000
  ip_address = "172.83.124.10"
  type       = "ipsec.1"

  tags {
    Name = "main-customer-gateway"
  }
}

module "vpc" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"

  enable_vpn_gateway = true

  ...
}
```

##### Without VPC module

```hcl
module "vpn_gateway" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/vpn-gateway/aws"

  vpn_gateway_id      = "${aws_vpn_gateway.vpn_gateway.id}"
  customer_gateway_id = "${aws_customer_gateway.main.id}"
  vpc_id              = "${aws_vpc.vpc.vpc_id}"
  vpc_subnet_ids      = ["${aws_subnet.*.id}"]
}

resource "aws_customer_gateway" "main" {
  bgp_asn    = 65000
  ip_address = "172.83.124.10"
  type       = "ipsec.1"

  tags {
    Name = "main-customer-gateway"
  }
}

resource "aws_vpc" "vpc" {
  ...
}

resource "aws_subnet" "one" {
  vpc_id = "${aws_vpc.vpc.vpc_id}"

  ...
}

resource "aws_subnet" "two" {
  vpc_id = "${aws_vpc.vpc.vpc_id}"

  ...
}

resource "aws_vpn_gateway" "vpn_gateway" {
  vpc_id = "${aws_vpc.vpc.vpc_id}"

  ...
}
```

Examples
--------

* [Complete example](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-vpn-gateway/tree/master/examples/complete-vpn-gateway) shows how to create all VPN Gateway resources.
* [Complete example with static routes](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-vpn-gateway/tree/master/examples/complete-vpn-gateway-with-static-routes) shows how to create all VPN Gateway together with static routes.
* [Minimal example](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-vpn-gateway/tree/master/examples/minimal-vpn-gateway) shows how to create just VPN Gateway using this module.
